How do I approach designing software? 

What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft? 

This project taught me a lot about frames, polygons, rendering, and the placement of elements on the screen. This will be really useful in the future when I need to design aesthetically appealing apps. Even if a project utilizes something like DirectX instead, understanding positioning, scaling, and placement will be necessary in order to truly grasp how programs interact with displays. For example, when I initially started performing website work with CSS and HTML, one item I didn't grasp was the z-index. It appears to function only sometimes, but the notion of the location on the z axis relative to other objects is now plainly evident to me. This has been an interesting topic to investigate.

What design process did you follow for your project work? 

For this project, I started by breaking identifying the target picture into its main components. I opted to make the rendering as abstract as possible after I got a preliminary approximation. This proved to be quite useful later on. After I finished the scene shelf, I focused on the texturing and lighting.

How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work? 

The design concept I used here has the potential to have a significant influence on future projects. In the past, several undertakings had minimal forethought, especially in school with limited time. This one really emphasized the need of having a comprehensive strategy in place from the start. I need to improve on it and include it into all of my future endeavors. I also need to abstract more, which is something I didn't do as much on previous projects. This project demonstrated the potential of approaches and parameters in making a scene dynamic. The callbacks were also intriguing, and it gave me a lot to think about when it came to incorporating more functionality with key and mouse inputs.

How do I approach developing programs? 

What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene? 

In the creation of this software, I employed interrupts and recursive calls. I just came up with a way to make it function after I had already submitted the project. I'd want to investigate recursion further since I believe it has the potential to be really efficient. In my application, though, I also employed interrupts. That was fascinating.

How did iteration factor into your development? 

Iteration had a significant role in my progress. I suppose this was just a plain cube. This taught me a lot about how forms functioned and, more significantly, how to alter the shapes in the environment.

How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion? 

Initially, I took a hardline attitude to things. Then it got a lot more abstract. After I started abstracting the various render methods, I learnt a lot about how they operate and how to control the forms. This ended up assisting me with lighting as well as other areas of the picture such as animation.


How can computer science help me in reaching my goals? 

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway? 
Visualizations may have completely altered my future scholastic route. Prior to this session, I had assumed that I had no interest in graphics. Then, as I progressed through these milestones, I acquired a little of a love for it. This is rather intriguing. I believe it's a fantastic topic of study, and I had no clue how complex and intricate it was.
